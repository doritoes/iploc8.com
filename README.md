Why one container for Flask and MySQL? Isn't the current pattern to use docker compose with separate containers for each service?
* I wanted portable container that could easily run on ECS
* The container loads the most recent geo data at instantiation in the database for lookup, but not updates are made
* The container "ages out" after a configurable amount of runtime, trigging another container to load with fresh data

Please be forewarned that this lab is fairly expensive. AWS promises to save you up to 50% on compute costs by utilizing autonomous scaling, provisioning, and usage-based pricing. However the costs of even a lab environment add up quickly. Here the top costs:
- VPC costs ðŸ’µ
  - includes public IP address pricing (Elastic IP)
    - For example us-east-1 (USE1-PublicIPv4:InUseAddress)
    - On 2/1/2024 Amazon started charging for public IP addresses in use
      - https://cybernews.com/tech/amazon-web-services-charge-ipv4-addresses/
      - Single IP is $3.60/month or $43.80/year
- ELB costs ðŸ’µ
  - you pay for AWS resources to run the load balancer(s)
  - per application load balancer-hour
  - per LCU-hour (load-based)
  - redue the number of regions
- ECS costs ðŸ’µ
  - you pay for the memory and vCPU resourcs the containers use
  - reduce costs by reducing the minimum required CPU and memory in the Task definition
  - reduce scaling - use step scaling and reduce the maximum number of tasks
  - reduce the number of regions
- Route53 - monthly cost
- EC2 costs / EC2 - Other
  - Idle Elastic IPs incur a small fee
  - ELB usage is charged a small fee

# Overview and Genesis
After building a few IP address look up sites on different technologies, I wanted to create my own custom geo-lookup API that I can leverage on my other sites.

The goal is to leverage repositories with geo-location data together with published IP address ranges to provide some unique perspective. There are many other API services that do enriched geo-location for a fee. However, the goal is this project is to develop the concept of what is possible independent of these services.

This demonstration site has the following features:
* Serverless computing on Fargate
* Python Flask with MySQL back-end database
* API design examples
  * unrestricted
  * JWT with API keys
  * CloudFront WAP protections
* Demonstrate global autoscaling container applications without breaking the bank (don't want to cost too much for this free site)

# Project Goals
Here are the goals I had for this project. This is meant to be a step-by-step Lab exercise that you can follow along to.

**IMPORTANT** The web site https://iploc8.com is being discontinued. The cost of AWS outweighs the value to me.

## In Scope
### Completed
- Register domain name
- Bootstrap repo and Dock hub image
- first geo API with country and ASN data
- second geo API with city data, secured with API key and JWT tokens
- third and fourth geo API integrating with ip-api.com
- CORS testing
- one region built in ECS with CloudFront and WAF protection
- multi-region
- Zscaler and Broadcom SWG address spaces
### Main Concerns
- Reducing costs of operation
### Missing Features
- MS published address spaces
- MS Azure customer space
- GCP customer space
- AWC customer space
- Tor published address spaces
- Threat Intel enrichment
  - Reputation/blacklists
## Out of Scope
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) doesn't meet my criteria for integrating a new technology for me. I have done other Kubernetes labs ([here](https://www.unclenuc.com/lab:kubernetes_app:start) and [here](https://www.unclenuc.com/lab:stack_of_nucs:start)).

# Quick Start
:warning: If you are using Windows, you need to do this in a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) window. Otherwise, you will have line ending issues with the scripts and other text files.

1. git clone https://github.com/doritoes/iploc8.com
2. cd iploc8.com
3. docker build -t my-flask-mysql .
4. docker run -p 5000:5000 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_password my-flask-mysql
    - you will see "MySQL is unavailable -sleeping" for while
    - Or run detached: docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_password my-flask-mysql
5. test
    - http://localhost:5000 - test page
    - http://localhost:5000/healthcheck - health check
    - http://localhost:5000/api/v1/ip?ip=67.248.106.77 - API v1
    - http://localhost:5000/test.html - API v2
